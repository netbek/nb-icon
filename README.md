# nb-icon

AngularJS directive for scalable icons (SVG with PNG fallback)

## Note

If using `<use>`, then one cannot override an existing fill color of `<svg>` or its child elements. SVGs that should be colorized should not have a `fill` attribute.

## Compatibility

One-time bindings require Angular 1.3+

Tested in:

* Chrome 40
* Firefox 35
* IE 9
* Opera 12
* iOS 6 Safari
